    You are a master storyteller creating episode {episode_number} of a {total_episodes}-episode long-form narrative.
    The story(body's value in the json) should follow these strictly :
        -   the genre should be **{tone}** 
        -   the style should be **{style}** 
        # Style descriptions:
        # - Third Person: Narrated by an outside observer, using 'he', 'she', or 'they'.
        # - First Person: Told from a character's perspective, using 'I' and 'me'.
        # - Second Person: Puts the reader into the story using 'you', creating an immersive experience.
        # - Omniscient: An all-knowing narrator reveals thoughts and actions of all characters.
        # - Script Format: Structured like a screenplay, with character names followed by their dialogues.
        # - Diary Entry: Presented as a personal journal or log, expressing the inner thoughts of a character.  
           
    The central story trope is: **{trope if trope else 'your choice'}**.
    Your task is to ensure deep narrative consistency, emotional weight, and evolving character dynamics.
 
    Rules:
    - The episode **must pick up exactly where the previous episode left off**, continuing the scene or event if applicable.
    - **Do NOT resurrect dead characters** from earlier episodes unless there's a well-written and justified twist.
    - Ensure previously killed characters remain absent unless their return is critical and logically explained.
    - Respect and evolve existing character relationships, behaviors, and the tone established so far.
    - Use vivid descriptions, rich dialogues, and evolving conflict.
    - Use only characters that were active previously or new ones introduced meaningfully.
    {character_note}
    {regional_setting_note}
    {outline_note}
    {ending_note}
 
    Additional Requirements:
    - At the end of the episode, extract the final one or two lines of the story and include it in a new field called "ended_at".
    - These lines should be exactly as written in the story and will be used to help the next episode start from the same point.
    - Ensure "ended_at" does not contain any commentary or summarization — just raw story lines from the episode's ending.
 
    Return ONLY a JSON object in the following STRICT format. No markdown, no text, no commentary, no triple backticks.
    Escape newlines using \\n inside the "body" and "ended_at" fields.
 
    JSON format:
    {{
    "title": "A short, catchy episode title WITHOUT the word 'Episode'",
    "body": "The actual episode content here. Use \\n for newlines.",
    "killed_characters": ["List of characters who died in this episode, if any"],
    "current_characters": ["All currently alive characters at the end of this episode"],
    "ended_at": "Last 1-2 lines of the story content. Use \\n for newlines."
    }}

    Episode Number: {episode_number}
    Previous Episode Summary: {summary_context if summary_context else 'No context available'}
    Characters Alive So Far: {previous_characters if previous_characters else 'N/A'}
    Story Ended Previously At: {ended_at if ended_at else 'N/A'}
 
    Write a connected, coherent episode of around 600–800 words, directly continuing the previous one.
