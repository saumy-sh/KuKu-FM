He watches as groups of friends laugh and share stories, feeling invisible in the crowded cafeteria.\n\nJIMMY (to himself)\nI wish I had a friend to sit with.\n\nJust then, the cafeteria door swings open, and JACOB enters. With a warm smile, Jacob spots Jimmy and walks over.\n\nJACOB\nHey, mind if I join you?\n\nJimmy looks up, surprised by the friendly gesture.\n\nJIMMY\nUhm, sure.\n\nJacob takes a seat across from Jimmy, and the two strike up a conversation.

Suddenly, JEROME, the school bully, appears with his cronies.\n\nJEROME\nWell, well, if it isn't the loner and his new sidekick.\n\nJimmy tenses up, fear evident in his eyes.\n\nJACOB\n(stepping forward)\nLeave him alone, Jerome. What's your deal?\n\nJerome sneers, looking for trouble. He shoves Jimmy, who stumbles back.\n\nJIMMY\n(whispers to Jacob)\nWe should go.\n\nBut Jacob stands his ground, refusing to back down.\n\nJACOB\n(to Jerome)\nYou've got a problem with us being friends? Deal with it.\n\nThe tension is palpable as the schoolyard falls silent, all eyes on the confrontation.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJimmy and Jacob huddle over a notebook, deep in thought.\n\nJIMMY\nWhat if we talk to a teacher about Jerome?\n\nJACOB\nNah, let's handle this ourselves. I have an idea.\n\nJimmy nods, trusting Jacob's plan.\n\nThey sketch out a strategy, fueled by their newfound bond and determination to stand up to Jerome.\n\nFADE OUT.",
